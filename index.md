## Introduction

I am a senior student at the University of Michigan, pursuing a **B.S.E. in Computer Science**. I am now an Research Assistant in OrderLab and CHAI Lab, and also an IA in Umich EECS 445 (Machine Learning).

I transfered from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) on my third year (2023), where I majored ECE in SJTU. 

My academic focus is on **Machine Learning** and **Operating Systems**. 

<!-- Currently, I am working on **ML-Daikon**, a tool designed to detect silent issues in machine learning training pipelines, by checking low-level invariants and enhancing system reliability.  -->

I am passionate about merging knowledge with  **Machine Learning** and **Operating Systems**.

## Selected Projects

### **ML-Daikon**  
*Research Project | University of Michigan | May 2024 - Present*  
ML-Daikon is a tool designed to detect silent issues in machine learning training pipelines. By inferring low-level invariants, it helps identify bugs that may otherwise go unnoticed. The project incorporates a static analyzer and dynamic analysis for enhanced PyTorch debugging. I successfully identified significant bugs, such as **PyTorch issue 84803**, proving the tool's real-world effectiveness.

### **AI Model for Speech Annotation**  
*Research Project | University of Michigan | May 2024 - Present*  
This project involves using machine learning to analyze speech patterns and help clinicians identify diseases. I led a team to predict speech disfluencies using BERT for advanced language recognition, incorporating both wav2vec2 and ASR+text embeddings. The project also involved data sourcing and cleaning from AphasiaBank, resulting in a higher-quality dataset for model training.

### **Thread and Pager for Systems**  
*Course Project | University of Michigan | Apr 2024*  
I designed a custom thread scheduling system and a pager system for virtual memory management. The project aimed to improve memory handling by dynamically loading memory pages from disk and managing page faults, ensuring system efficiency in multi-tasking environments.

### **Compiler Construction (LLVM and Oat)**  
*Course Project | University of Michigan | Mar 2024*  
This project focused on building a non-optimizing compiler that translates LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) to X86lite assembly. I implemented features like function calls, memory management, and type safety to ensure the compiler operated according to standard conventions.

### **Online Games Based on Elm Programming**  
*Course Project | Shanghai Jiao Tong University | May 2022 - Aug 2022*  
I led the design and development of video games using Elm. The games, including a Brick game and an open-world shooting game, utilized custom artwork and innovative gameplay elements. I also integrated JavaScript to extend the functionality of the games, demonstrating my versatility in multiple programming languages. -->
