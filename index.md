## Introduction

I‚Äôm Beijie Liu, a systems research enthusiast and coffee-dependent humanoid currently finishing my B.S.E. at the University of Michigan. I work as a Research Assistant in **OrderLab** and **CHAI Lab**, and I‚Äôve also survived being an IA for EECS 445 (Intro to Machine Learning).  
 
Before transferring to UMich in 2023, I studied ECE at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Somehow, this means I now use both C++ *and* React in the same week. Please keep me in your thoughts.

My work focuses on **GPU microarchitecture**, **training pipeline reliability**, and **system-level analysis**‚Äîbecause someone has to care when your model silently fails and no one knows why.

## Selected Research Projects

### üîç Training with Confidence: Catching Silent DL Training Bugs with Automated Proactive Checks  
**OrderLab, University of Michigan**  
*Advised by Prof. Ryan Huang and PhD candidate Yuxuan Jiang*

- Developed a static analyzer for PyTorch, targeting tightly coupled Python‚ÄìC/C++ boundaries  
- Built a dynamic tracing system to recover API signatures and data dependencies  
- Introduced a ‚ÄúVar Preserve Invariant‚Äù pattern to detect silent DL bugs‚Äîyes, it caught [real ones](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/84803)  
- Published at **OSDI 2025**  
- Summary: I make your deep learning training pipeline less of a ticking time bomb.

### üß† AI Model for Speech Disfluency Detection  
**CHAI Lab, University of Michigan**  
*Advised by Prof. Emily Mower Provost*

- Adapted a dual-path model combining **wav2vec2** (for sound) and **ASR-BERT** (for text)  
- Deployed results into a live Excel tool for clinicians, because apparently not everyone loves Jupyter Notebooks  
<!-- - Presented at two SURE showcase events   -->
<!-- - [SURE Poster Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18tgPN8d5c8C0TmgP1R8ZP21tfDdbpCq8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116168255113253838830&rtpof=true&sd=true) -->

## Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: C++, Python, Bash, Golang, OCaml, JavaScript (yes, I touch React under duress)
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Nsight Compute, Google Cloud, VS Code (the usual suspects)
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Soft Skills**: Debugging other people's code, staring into the abyss of dynamic traces

## Fun(?) Facts

- My favorite OS is Linux, but I type this from a Mac. I contain multitudes.  
- I like fish. Not the animal‚Äîthe shell. [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/), to be specific.  
- I use [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) because typing out `git` commands is for people with more time than I have.   
- Please don‚Äôt touch my laptop screen. That‚Äôs how bugs spread.  
- I keep a diary. It‚Äôs where I confess to segfaults I pretend weren‚Äôt my fault.
