## Introduction

I am a senior student at the University of Michigan, pursuing a **B.S.E. in Computer Science**. I am now an Research Assistant in OrderLab and CHAI Lab, and also an IA in Umich EECS 445 (Intro to Machine Learning).

I transferred from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in my third year (2023), where I majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

My academic focus is on **Machine Learning**, **Operating Systems**, and **Compilers**. 

I am planning to take **Distributed Sys**, **Advanced Compilers** later.

I am passionate about merging knowledge with  **Machine Learning** and **Operating Systems**.

## Selected Projects

### - Training with Confidence: Catching Silent DL Training Bugs with Automated Proactive Checks

> Supervised by **Prof. Ryan Huang** and **PHD Yuxuan Jiang** in **OrderLab**

This is a tool designed to detect silent issues in machine learning training pipelines. By inferring low-level invariants and detecting with high-level pattern recognition, it helps identify bugs that may otherwise go unnoticed.

Sample bugs: [PyTorch Issues 84803](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/84803). The issue involves silent data corruption when moving tensors between GPUs in PyTorch. The bug manifests when a tensor is transferred between GPUs, causing incorrect values without errors.

A workaround is to transfer the tensor to the CPU before moving it to another GPU. The issue was confirmed across different PyTorch versions.

### - AI Model for Speech Annotation

> Supervised by **Prof. Emily Mower Provost** in **CHAI Lab**

We use machine learning to analyze speech patterns and help clinicians identify diseases, incorporating both wav2vec2 and ASR+text embeddings. 

The project involved data sourcing and cleaning from AphasiaBank, resulting in a higher-quality dataset for model training. We used Webrtcvad to make sentence segmentations more robust. Additionally, a website was created to help clinicians better visualize the results.

## More about Me

My favorite OS is Linux, but I am using Mac.

I am a fan of [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) and [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for their user-friendly features.

I enjoy coffee, especially lattes.

I have a strong preference for cleanliness and prefer not to have my Mac screen touched.

I keep a diary to document my everyday thoughts.
